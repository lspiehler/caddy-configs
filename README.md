# Caddy Configs

Download caddy from https://caddyserver.com/download?package=github.com%2Fcaddyserver%2Ftransform-encoder with the transform-encoder

Run caddy by pointing to a specific config using a command like the one below
```
caddy_windows_amd64_custom.exe run --config caddy.json

The default config demonstrates the use of manually generated certificates and a custom logging configuration.
